            This is most likely my biggest solo project, or at least it felt
            like it back when I was doing it.

          The main idea is that the user uploads a zip file to the left box and
          generates a key using a button that asks for a key in the back-end.
          This key is randomly generated each time. This returns a json file
          with encrypted binary data and an IV (initialization vector) attached
          to it in the last entry of the json array. Lastly the user (or a
          different user who has the file) uploads it to the right box with the
          original key to reconstruct the zip file!
        </p>
        <p>
          My focus was to make something "useful", I didn't pay much attention
          to the front-end as it was not the focus of Crypted at all. The magic
          happens in the back-end.
        </p>
        <p>
          The front-end was made with react, the back-end was made with the
          express framework on node.js. I did not use any kind of database for
          this project because to my mind, there was no need to store permanent
          information.
