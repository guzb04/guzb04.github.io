            This is the project that I have spent the most time on, with the
            help an awesome team
          </p>
          <p>
            The e-commerce site took our team 4 months, it was made in 2 week
            sprints, 8 sprints in total and it was the first big project I ever
            made, courtesy of JÃ³venes A Programar
          </p>

            There's things I would have liked to do different without a doubt
            now that I am more confortable with web development, but it does
            look nice and it was a very cool project to work on
          </p>
          <p>
            I also had a very good team and I learnt a lot about working in
            teams and forming friendships with my partners.
          </p>
          <p>
            I had to be responsible, both for my own sake and the sake of my
            team, and at the end we got 100% for it as our final project!!
